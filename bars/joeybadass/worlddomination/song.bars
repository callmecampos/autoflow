Ayo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow, point 'em out bitch
I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
Check
Puffin on stramonium, underground like potholes
But going fossil, these bars like art in the Smithsonian
These flows is for custodians, homeless men horny O-B-GYN dudes
Browsin' my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like yo Joey you rude I'm like if only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology that's why I act as lonely as you
You see I'm wise beyond my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
What I got behind my membrane but I been smokin' chemstrains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies show Egyptians ain't shit
Cuz I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck I'm erratic mama lock me in the attic
Please till I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of blueprints and Illmatics
I been goin raw, this just how I feel rappin
We gave y'all Sur tactics so y'all can't even gas us
We taught y'all how to be prepared but still attackin the masses
Y'all better get y'all caskets cuz we bout to annihilate
The new Babylon era my empire gates in the Empire State
I'm on a higher platform look at the way they clap for 'em
Never fuck with phony men cuz I don't like my back torn
Nigga ask Kwon this that top ramen you ain't used to
Keep it neutral to scrupule then tell 'em no beef like noodles
Keep it neutral just so you can scrupule
I tell 'em no beef like noodles
It's world domination nation you tunin' to my station
Always got a doobie and a mothafuckin eighth lit
Always got the trees so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin team
It's world domination nation you tunin' to my station
Always got a doobie and a mothafuckin eighth lit
Always got the trees so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin team
Ayo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow, point 'em out bitch
I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
Ayo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow, point 'em out bitch
I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
