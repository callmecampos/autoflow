Ayo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow, point 'em out bitch
I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic

Puffin on stramonium, underground like potholes
But going fossil, these bars like art in the Smithsonian
The flows is for custodians, homeless men horny O-B-GYN dudes
Browsin' my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like yo Joey you rude I'm like if only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology that's why I act as lonely as you
You see I'm wise beyond my years and peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way the hear
What I got membrane but I been smokin' chemstrains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies show Egyptians ain't shit
Cuz I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck I'm erratic mama lock me in the attic
Please till I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of blueprints and Illmatics
I been goin raw, this just how I feel rappin
