Ok finally, got a piece of the profit
Wine and cheese, in the seat by the cockpit
I ain't mean for your bitch to be watchin
I am me, she kept eyein me
Everyday we just makin' deep profits
Money long I'm gon' need some deep pockets
Hands are to the ceiling when I'm in the building
How you make a livin'
Lately never chillin' mind is on a million things I gotta do
Ladies want me with 'em no time for chillin' no time for you
I been on a different type of time
I never like the rest a different type of grind
I'm on South Beach like Tony Montan'
Feelin' like the whole world is mine
