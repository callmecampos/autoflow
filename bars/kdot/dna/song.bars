I got I got I got I got
Loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power poison pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate I meditate then off your fucking head
This that put the kids to bed
