Yeah Freddie got a better voice than me
But your verses like a bad oyster see
Cuz they all full of salt and watery
I'm talkin bout life like I'm ninety three
Easy ride I'm sick it's plain to see
Ain't ever gonna act holier than thee
Heaven to earth that's an upside tree
Roots of the the sun rain down on me
Black thought dapped at the festival
Mike jumped the fence he ain't paid in full
God gave me this brain so I can rap about
All the crazy shit I wanna say aloud
Don't gotta rhyme I just gotta flow state
Worried all the time about a little glow fade
Drop some acid that's a little more made
Rip tryptamine I'm a hella bored sage
Love the Earth she my oasis in space
Spittin rhymes like I'm on the main stage
Get back in your seat you just happy GA

I'm already on the next page

Got some blue verses don't know where the fuck my worst is
Dead dreams half amazing it's a war inside myself I'm fazing
Rhyme schemes got me red hot fuckin tik tok got me deadlocked
That's cake let em eat it Uncle Sam can fuckin beat it
Vibe legato spit staccatto be myself I won that lotto
I go hard like old Mo Bamba Easy Rider Action flow
Time to manifest my rhyme life's a bitch you know she's
