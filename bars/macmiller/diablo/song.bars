It's the Rap Diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho rockin shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie all their promises were hollow
Follow me, I can show you where we beez at
How'd I get my G pass, none of your fuckin beezwax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little eight ball, show me where the keys at
The time continuum, mortal combat finish 'em
Tryna find my balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't savin nothin', I'm gettin' faded till the angels comin
Skippin all the famous functions, how do the famous function
The A list can't be trusted, I strong arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch if she don't love me than just lie to me
I'm finer than a winery, takin' from the rich this is piracy
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin eyes to see
Come and die with me
Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a D V D
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
