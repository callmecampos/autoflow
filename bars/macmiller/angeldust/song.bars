Writin' on writer's block
Haven't slept in days they wanna put me in a psycho watch
Everyone's afraid of what I do inside my studio
Worried I'mma lose control, they rufflin the feathers
And they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh, execution flow
Action act like new cologne, uno dos
Bitch I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger tho
My brain fried always chasin the same high I'm too
Fucked up to function do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated lying on pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
