Opportunity be knockin'
Ya gotta let a mufucka in
I kiss my mother on the cheek
Tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry bout a ting I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

All my life I was a fuck up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin out the window screamin what what
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby oh my lord, the cops chasin' Bronson in an all white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all night tour
Bitch I'm alright but I'm off that raw
I'm in the robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican but I'm not lord
Hot hoes every city that we go singin'
Heads high kill em with it now
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic summers on the sail boat
Don't even try to call him not available for nothin
Unless it's stupid paper, about the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh
