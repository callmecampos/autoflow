Indo, kushed out
Trillest nigga living ever pushed out
Never finished college like my brother or my sister
I was in the crib laying on a kush cloud
Getting zoned out, eyes red
Momma and my daddy said my mind dead
They said I never had a clue, said the bills past due
Fuck you, nigga, you gotta remind Fred
Cause I'm carefree, sucker-free
Remember when these niggas wouldn't fuck with me
But now I'm on the screen and these magazines
They be trying to stop a nigga like, smoke something, G
Can we get a couple grams? Nigga, hell, naw
Unless you come in with the cash, tried to tell y'all
I got you motherfuckers gassed on the smell, dawg
So go 'head and take a hit of what I'm 'bout to sell y'all
I gets high
